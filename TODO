* Fix warning / critical bug.
  - All matches should be inclusive.
  - @ actually inverts the match.
* Add ability to set warning / critical level through API call.
* Add class for Network-enabled scripts
  - Should reserve '-H' for host.
  - Should reserve '-p' for port.
  - etc.
* Add class for Database-enabled scripts
  - As with network script, reserve database-related parameters.

* Include wanring and critical flags by default, don't require enable_status. 
* Include a get method for grabbing http resources (Requests library a good fit)
* Decouple performance metrics from threshold checking (maintain backwards compatibility)
* Don't require start and finish calls, make them noops for backwards compatibility
  - Run option parser on demand
  - Register an atexit callback to produce output and exit cleanly (even after an exception)
* Remove the optparser magic, the parser should be a simple wrapper (but maintain back-compat)
* Add timeouts congruent with nagios plugin developer guidelines (SIGALRM and socket.setdefaulttimeout)
